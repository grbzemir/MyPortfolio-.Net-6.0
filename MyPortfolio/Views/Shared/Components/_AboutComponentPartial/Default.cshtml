            <h3>Hello!</h3>

            <p>
                I developed and maintained web applications using
                ReactJs, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS. I have a deep
                experience in responsive design with TailwindCss, and I
                optimized the user interface of various internal projects. I
                developed RESTful APIs using C#, Entity Framework and
                .NET Core, and implemented LINQ queries for data
                retrieval.
                I contributed to the design and deployment of MySQL
                database solutions in collaboration with senior
                developers, ensuring high performance and scalability. I
                actively participated in code review processes, helping to
                maintain coding standards and ensuring that the team
                followed best practices.
                I participated in sprint planning, daily stand-up meetings
                and retrospectives within the framework of Agile Scrum
                methodology, increasing the efficiency of the software
                development process. I contributed to the development
                and testing of software features, increasing the stability
                of the software by 20% and reducing bug reports.
            <p>
                Within the scope of the PortalIntellium Project, I carried
                out extensive work using C#, Entity Framework, .NET
                Core and PostgreSQL to improve the user experience in
                the Back End of the Expense Management system in
                accordance with the Layered Architecture logic. During
                this process, I made Back End developments with C# and
                .NET to manage users' authorization parameters in the
                system.
                In the Front End part of the PortalIntellium Project, I
                developed the user interface using React.js, Redux, React
                Router DOM and ContextAPI. Using these technologies, I
                integrated the C# and .NET codes I wrote in the Back End
                and improved the user experience. During this process, I
                gained in-depth knowledge and experience in application
                state management with React.js and Redux, page
                redirects with React Router DOM and data sharing across
                the application with ContextAPI.
